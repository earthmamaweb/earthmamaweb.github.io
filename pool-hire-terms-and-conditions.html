                <h3>
                    Please watch this quick link before setting up pool
                </h3>

                <h3>Important Information:</h3>
                <p>
                    Inflatables require careful handling to avoid pin holes, cuts and abrasions. When inflating your pool, please ensure there is nothing underneath that could cause damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We strongly recommend that you test your pool for possible leaks, at least two weeks prior to expected use.
                </p>

                <h3>Inflating your pool</h3>
                <p>
                    DO NOT OVER-INFLATE YOUR POOL - over-inflation is the most common cause of air leaks.<br />

                    ﻿﻿﻿INFLATE THE FLOOR FIRST, using a small needle adaptor, into the small valve in the floor.<br />

                    ﻿﻿﻿INFLATE THE WALL, using the large black valve, until firm by inflating, after removing the top cap, which makes it a one way valve. Make sure that the small white valve close by, is closed.<br />

                    MUST ALWAYS USE LINER SUPPLIED<br />

                    Your pool is now ready to be filled. To avoid possible weakening of the seams of the pool, please do not exceed 39 degrees C, (100 F) Water temperature.<br />

                    FILL TO FILL LINE ON THE INSIDE OF POOL - you can make water level. adjustments after you are submerged in the pool.<br />
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Emptying your pool
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Your water pump will empty the pool quickly and efficiently, but bear in mind that the higher the water has to be pumped, the harder the pump has to work and the longer it will take. Therefore, if possible, empty pool into a drain, rather than an elevated sink.
                </p>

                <hr class="divider divider-light" />
                <h3>
                    Cleaning your pool
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once the pool is empty, wash the pool inside and out with a solution of warm water and soap (washing up liquid is fine), and a soft cloth. Rinse the pool with clean water (in the garden with a hose pipe is easiest) then wipe over the inside with a sterilising solution and kitchen towel. Leave the pool to dry thoroughlybefore packing away.
                </p>

                <hr class="divider divider-light" />
                <h3>
                    Deflating your pool
                </h3>
                <p>
                    ﻿﻿﻿Open the base black valve on the side of the pool to let most of the air out, in the meantime deflate the floor with the smallest nozzle of the pump until all the air is removed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ﻿﻿﻿A small amount of air will remain in the side of the pool. Replace the large black valve and continue deflating the walls through the small white valve.
                    Insert the correct nozzle and continue deflating the walls with the pump until all the air is removed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ensure the walls are folded in over the base; fold the pool in half length ways before rolling it and placing it in its storage bag.
                </p>

                    <li>Your hire is for 6 WEEKS. Delivery 37wks and Pick Up 42 weeks or whenever you birth.</li>

                    <li>Your hire includes a birthing pool, inflating pump, drain pump, disposable liner and inflatable seat.</li>

                    <li>The birthing pool will only be used according to the instructions provided. See QR code on side of pool for instructions. Cherie Nixon will not be held responsible or liable for any injury or damage sustained as a result of misusing the birthing pool.</li>

                    <li>Your birthing pool has been checked, cleaned and sanitised, and it will be supplied to you to the best out our ability in perfect working order.</li>

                    <li>The birthing pool is NOT to be used without a disposable liner.</li>

                    <li>Used disposable liner is to be thrown out by the customer or kept for future births or reuse for home use when possible. For example keep and dig a hole and create a backyard pond for you to use in summer as a mini pool. The kids will love it. Hose it down post birth and hand it out to dry. Perfecto. Try and be environmentally friendly.</li>

                    <li>Emptying of the birthing pool is only to commence once the birthing pool has been completely VACATED. The submersible pump and hose is NOT to be placed into the water until the pool has been completely vacated.</li>

                    <li>We recommend that you prepare your birthing pool, inflate early and even have a trial run when possible. Depending on facilities it can take 40-60min to fill.</li>

                    <li>No refunds will be given if you did not end up using the birthing pool. Though if for some reason you didn’t get to use it in labour or birth please feel free to have a re birth in the pool and enjoy this moment with your newborn. This can be very healing especially when birth wishes don’t go according to plan.</li>

                    <li>This bundle is hired on the understanding that it will only be used by the person on the booking, and not transferable between others people.</li>

                    <li>It is the responsibility of the customer/hirer to check all the contents for the birthing pool hire package, upon receipt. The customer must advise Cherie immediately if there are any problems. Cherie does NOT accept responsibility where the customer fails to do so.</li>

                    <li>The birthing pool is within warranty for use, whereby the manufacturer warrants 40 uses.</li>

                    <li>The customer/hirer accepts responsibility for all risk from any use of the birthing pool.</li>
